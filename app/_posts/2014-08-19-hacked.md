Catering to those who wish to operate in *read-only* mode, Hacked taps into the Hacker News API to display the top 30 posts. 
Although readers cannot comment, they can still share posts and save to Pocket. In a later release, Hacked will allow the user to follow other media sites.

 *Currently being developed and will be available on the app store soon.*
