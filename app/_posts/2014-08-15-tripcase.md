On a recent trip home to Dallas, I used a handy app called TripCase. The app aggregates all of your travel confirmations and creates a de facto itinerary. Although I enjoyed the functionality, 
I felt the UI could use a face-lift. Always looking to refine my iOS design skills, I took a stab at some mockups. The icons used are a great [free set](https://dribbble.com/shots/1634821-440-Free-Icons) from BigMug.
