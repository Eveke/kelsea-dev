**Project Goals:** I have recently been using the TripCase app. I love the robust functionality which includes the ability to forward all reservation email confirmations (air, hotel, diner reservations, ect.) to their system which then creates an itinerary. I felt, however, that the UI could use an update and the user pathways could use a few tweaks and used this an opportunity to refine my ios design skills. The icons used are a great [free set](https://dribbble.com/shots/1634821-440-Free-Icons) from BigMug.
