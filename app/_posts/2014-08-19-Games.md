With over 250,000 participants, five weekly workouts, and some stiff competition, competitors needed to track, update, and share their standings.
The CrossFit Games app allows users to quickly submit scores, view media posts, and spend countless hours ["leaderboarding"](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Leaderboarding).
