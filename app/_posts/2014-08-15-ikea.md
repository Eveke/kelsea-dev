**Project Goals:** The Certified CrossFit Trainer credential was designed to give the CrossFit training community 
the opportunity to demonstrate their coaching knowledge and expertise. The project involved designing landing pages, 
a pre-application screening process, a exam application and final user portal where certified users 
can register and report class attendance. Adding to the complexity, the CCFT process adhere to strict 
guidelines from ANSI, a third party accreditation service.
