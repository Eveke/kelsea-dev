**Project Goals:** The Team Series is an online competition that allows people from all around the world to compete in team workouts. The project required the following: a leaderboard with filtering capability, a registration process, a portal that allowed team managers to send email invites to prospective team members, a team profile page, and competition description page for each weekend covering multiple workouts.
