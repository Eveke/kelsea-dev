**Project Goals:** When I have time, I have been exploring a new process where 
I start with a pencil drawing, snap a photo, pull it into photoshop and apply multiple contrast filters. 
From there, I create masks and remove pixels in a reverse process to create depth. I then apply a large bold background color 
and create textured patterns for the hair.
