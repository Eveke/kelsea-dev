**Project Goals:** I love the robust functionality offered by the TripCase app, with handy features such as the ability to forward all reservation email confirmations (air, hotel, diner reservations, ect.) to their system which then creates a personalized travel itinerary. I felt, however, that the UI could use an update and the user flow could use a few tweaks so I used this as an opportunity to refine my iOS design skills. The icons used are a great [free set](https://dribbble.com/shots/1634821-440-Free-Icons) from BigMug.
