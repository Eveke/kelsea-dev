**Project Goals:** Hacked taps into the Hacker News API and displays the top 30 posts. The app UI is catered to those who wish to operate in *read-only* mode and not necessarily comment or vote (although users can still share and save to Pocket). The user can also quickly access the original link from the nav bar. In a the later release, Hacked will allow the user to follow other media and news sites, again displaying only the most recent 30 posts. 

 *Currently being developed and will be available on the app store soon.*
