**Project Goals:** The Certified CrossFit Trainer credential is designed to give the CrossFit training community the opportunity to formally demonstrate their coaching knowledge and expertise. The project involved designing landing pages, a pre-application screening process, an exam application and final user portal where certified users can register and report class attendance. Adding to the complexity, the CCFT process adheres to strict guidelines required by ANSI, a third party accreditation service.
